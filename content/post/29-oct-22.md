In the picture above, I have drawn objects which are equally spaced. Finding centers in perspective drawings is difficult with ruler and even that does not help in getting it. By drawing diagonals we can get centers of the objects or position of equally spaced objects. It helps us draw items in perspective easily like rubix cubes, window panes, tiles, fence, etc.
