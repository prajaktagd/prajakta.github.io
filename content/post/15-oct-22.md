In two point perspective drawings, objects converge on two vanishing points. The vanishing points are placed on horizon line. The parallel lines that recedes to the vanishing points are called orthogonal lines.

To draw in two point perspective, start with two vanishing points on the horizon and a vertical line. The vertical line makes the corner of the object. Further draw lines from the end points of the vertical line to the vanishing points.
