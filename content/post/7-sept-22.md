One point perspective is a drawing method used to draw objects on a flat drawing surface so that they look three-dimensional and realistic. It shows how things appear to get smaller when they get away, converging to a single vanishing point.

In one point perspective drawing, all non-vertical and non-horizontal lines vanish into a single point called vanishing point which is placed on the horizon line often in the center of the picture(not necessary).

To start with it, draw the horizon line with a vanishing point and a shape. Further draw lines from that shape which converge to that vanishing point.
