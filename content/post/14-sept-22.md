Started reading book on perspective drawings called 'Perspective Made Easy' by Ernest R. Norling.

Horizon is the height of our eyes no matter where we are above the ground, so we can say that horizon is nothing but our eye level.

The perspective changes when we see at eye level, above the eye level or below the eye level.

So, while drawing consider the horizon at your eye level and where you see(above, below or same) based on that, draw.
