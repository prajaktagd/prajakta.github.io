In three point perspective parallel lines along the width of an object meet at two separate points on the horizon and vertical lines on the object meet at a point on the perpendicular bisector of the horizon line.

It uses three sets of orthogonal lines and three vanishing points to draw an object. It is used to show epic height or depth to an object.

To draw in three point perspective, start with two vanishing points on the horizon and third vanishing point on the perpendicular bisector (usually far from the horizon). Draw orthogonal lines that recedes to respective vanishing points.
